#Logical operators
#1
x = 5

print(x > 3 and x < 10) #Output: returns True because 5 is greater than 3 AND 5 is less than 10

#2
x = 5

print(x > 3 or x < 4)

# Output: returns True because one of the conditions are true (5 is greater than 3, but 5 is not less than 4)

#3
x = 5

print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))

# Output: returns False because not is used to reverse the result
